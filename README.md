# Pure Javascript Pong Inspired Game
This is an arcade style Pong inspired game using pure javascript and the HTML5 canvas.
## Motivation
The inception of this project started when I was first new to development and desired to understand Object-Oriented Programming. At the same time, I had always been in awe of how simple physics can be replicated in programming. These were driving forces in creating this 2D Pong inspired game.
##Build Status
Complete
##Features
Many Pong clones have been made before. That's why I ventured to make one with many features and unique art styles to do something different.
### Difficulty Level
The player can go against the computer on three different difficulty levels. These are Easy, Medium, and Impossible. These levels affect the speed, reaction time, and general competency of the computer.
### Paddle Size
Also, the user can select tiny, average, or large paddles sizes for both the computer and the player, adding further difficulty or ease to play.
### Score Limit
With differing paddle sizes, there are cases where more points can accumulate quicker. So, I made it so the score limit could be adjusted anywhere from 5 for quick and easy games to 100 for the long marathons.
### Ball Count 
One of my favorite features is the player's ability to determine how many balls they want. The base level is 1, but it goes all the way to 5. Additionally, the balls bounce off each other in a way that's similar to basic physics using vectors. Once each ball is created in the game, they each vary somewhat in size and speed. 
### Art Style and Music
This was perhaps one of the most unique aspects to the game. The player can select between 3 different graphics of menu and play being: Classic, Mlitary, and Crystal. Here some pictures of the gameplay with each of these maps:

I definitely wanted to include a classic style map, just to give homage to the original Pong game. The art pieces in this were pretty straight forward to make for me.

In this map, I wanted one that had more of an appeal to boys and that demographic in general. The symmetry of the trenches was thought to go well with the general shape of the canvas. All images and here are open source and do not require attribution. It took quite a bit of time to find them.

Here, is a rather pretty crystal map that appeals to the demographic of young girls, or meant to appeal to. I also find it aesthetically appealing.

There was only one piece of music used in this game with an On and Off switch on the home menu. Attribution was given in the source code and on the physical menu itself. Here is what the menu looks like in the Arcade style for reference:

### Paddle Collision
Another feature that's somtimes easy to overlook is the paddle collision. When the ball hits the edge of the paddle, there's a temporary increase in speed of the ball. This encourages the player to take more risk and vary their strategy in playing against the computer.

## Installation
Playing this game is relatively straightforward as the program can be downloaded and ran in most modern browsers.
